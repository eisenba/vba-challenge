Goals:
    loop through stock data and return summary stats for each ticker symbol
        - summary stats needed
            + ticker symbol
            + yearly change between open price on first day 
              to closing price on last day
            + percent annual change
            + total stock volume (total number of shares that changed hands)
        - Conditional formatting on yearly change
    Challenge
        - return the ticker symbol and value for stocks that meet the following criteria
            + Greatest % increase
            + Greatest % decrease
            + Greatest total volume
    
Dataset observations:
    each year is in its own sheet
    each year-sheet is sorted by ticker symbol then date
    each row reports open, high, low, close, volume for each ticker symbol for each day
    Field descriptions
        - <ticker>
            + short string
            + All caps letters with occasional special characters ("-" and "." found)
        - <date>
            + 6 digit date represented as integer with format YYYYMMDD
            + first day always 01/01/20xx
            + last day not always 12/31/20xx
        -  <open>
            + number with up to two decimal places
        - <high> 
            + number with up to two decimal places
        - <low>
            + number with up to two decimal places
        - <close>
            + number with up to two decimal places
        - <vol>
            + number with usually 5 digits. Occasional 0s. Sometimes up to 8 digits 
            
Conceptual Approach:
    Goal : 
        - For each ticker symbol
            + find and save initial opening price
            + find and save last closing price
            + running sum of daily volume values
    Challenge :
        - search for max and min in % change
            + return results
        - search for max in total volume
            + return result
    Likely Fields needed :  
        - ticker symbol
        - total change (very first open - very last close)
        - percent change
        - total volume (sum)
    Needed data:
        - list of ticker symbols
        - first and last day of the year
        - very first open
        - very last close

To Do: 
    1. create list of ticker symbols
        - for each row
            + if <ticker>.row != <ticker>.row-1 then
                -- append results list
    2. (not needed)
    3. set first open and last close for year (min and max)
    4. Loop for volume
        - for each ticker symbol
            + for each day
                -- add volume to total volume
                -- next day
            + save in results list
    5. return results
    6. next year-sheet
