In this project, I created a VBA script to automate the calculation of summary statistics for 
stock data from 2014, 2015, and 2016. While the script functioned on smaller datasets, I was not
able to complete a successful run on the full data set. I the VBA script is functional but requires
optimization to handle the stock data workbook in a reasonable time.

Below is a description of all folders and files included:
